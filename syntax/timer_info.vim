" Without `\zs`, the order of the rules matters:    easy to understand.
" From `:h :syn-priority`:
"
"         1. When multiple Match or Region items start in the same position,
"            the item defined last has priority.
"
" With `\zs`, `Interesting` always wins over `Callback`.
" Is it explained by:
"
"         3. An item that starts in an earlier position has priority over
"            items that start in later positions.
" ?
"
" With `\zs` + `contains`, `Callback` always wins over `Interesting`.
" Why???
" It seems that the rule stating  that characters before `\zs` (and after `\ze`)
" are consumed doesn't apply for nested syntax items.
" Find a MWE confirming this theory.
