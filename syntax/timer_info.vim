" The following comments apply to the `timerInfoCallback` rule.
"
" Without `\zs`, the order of the rules matters.
" This is expected; from `:h :syn-priority`:
"
" >     1. When multiple Match or Region items start in the same position,
" >        the item defined last has priority.
"
" With `\zs`, `Interesting` always wins over `Callback`.
" Is it explained by:
"
" >     3. An item that starts in an earlier position has priority over
" >        items that start in later positions.
"
" ?
"
" With  `\zs`  + `contains`  (in  the  `timerInfoInteresting` rule),  `Callback`
" always wins over `Interesting`.
" Why???
" It  seems that  the rule  stating that  characters before  `\zs` are  consumed
" doesn't apply for contained syntax items.
" Find a MWE confirming this theory.

" Update: I think that the rule is correct,  but the text of a contained item is
" parsed twice (once for the outer item, once for the inner item).
" The consumption of characters at the outer level only applies to outer items.
" Basically, I think the consumed characters are tied to a level of nesting.
